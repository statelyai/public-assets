# Stately public assets

Stately brand assets for folks working with the Stately team.

## Logos

PNG logos are all optimised with lossless compression before being added to this repository.

SVG logos in the `/svg-optimised-for-web` folder are all optimised for use on the web. These `.svg` files do not have `<title>` attributes, so please ensure they have accessible names added when you’re using them on the web. Read below for [alternative text suggestions](#alternative-text).

### Logomarks

Logomarks are the icon part of the logo. The logomarks in the `/logos` folder have the ideal space/padding in the image for use in avatars. Do not crop the logomark image if using in a square or round frame.
